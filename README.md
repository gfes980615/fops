# fops

The application can get some information from the file.

I used some third-party libraries :\
github.com/spf13/cobra \
github.com/gabriel-vasile/mimetype

Quick start:\
```go get github.com/gfes980615/fops```\
and ```go build``` this project

```fops help```\
can let you know what functions are available now.
